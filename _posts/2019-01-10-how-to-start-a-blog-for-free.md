## How do I get my Free Blog

There are a couple of options for getting your own hosted blog site up and running.
- WordPress.org Free plan
- GitHub Pages

If you are still not sure why you should start blogging see my [5 reasons post][5ReasonsPost].

## WordPress

To be clear there are two distinct WordPress sites, [WordPress.com][WordPressCOMLink] and [WordPress.org][WorkPressOrgLink] site. The latter is home of the open source software and would require you to find a place to host the site like [GoDaddy.com][GoDaddyLink]

On the [WordPress.com][WordPressCOMLink] you may create a free blog that you can later upgrade to paid versions with more functionality. This is where I originally started.

This has a little more complexity to setup but may be worth the time.

## GitHub Pages
