Thank you for visiting my site!

My name is Aaron Ralls, a cloud architect with 20 years of experience.  I have a depth of experience with Microsoft tools and technologies. I will focus on covering solutions for business process and emerging technologies.

Right-sized solutions â„¢ is a concept of focusing on resolving the business issue vs. the symptoms. Simple and affordable solutions are the goal.
